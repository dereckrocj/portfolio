<h2>Blob-refactoring</h2>
						<p>The blob presentation was amazing it taught me a lot of new things like how you can implement trigonometry
					into your code. Like with the uses of PIE,COS and sin to make objects moving around the screen bouncing on walls and changing direction when
							they hit the boarders. This impacted me as i now see the many different ways that computer science and math are all most the same thing as they both studie patterns and
							algorithms.with my refactoring I changed the hue so when they come closer in contact with each other the color change is more drastice
						</p>

<h2>Snake-refactoring</h2>
						<p>During my snake refacrtoring i learend alot of may important things like what a vector really is. A vector is an entity that has both magnitude and direction, this was a very important
							part of the project as the "snake" need to move around and interact with the spaces its in as well as the objects around it.The createVector function made it possible by giving the 
							snake a physical body you could say to interact.

<h2>Random flower-refactoring</h2>
						<p>The random flower presentation was amazing it taught me a lot of new things like how you can implement trigonometry
					into your code, as well as the use of the hue function in p5 and getAngle which creates new 2D vectors form an agnle.The way this has effected me is that I know 
							now how can tie themselfs into different things and have multipule uses.

<h2>INtro to P5.js</h2>
						<p>This project was something that I worked on my self As we were newly introduced to P5 to understande the HTML Its a basic code but that was the building block of this wesite.
							Along with git hub and free code camp this little project Gave me the understanding of how HTML really looks and hot each code snippet interactions with the wesite.

<h2>Freecodecamp sass</h2>
						<p>This module was a continuation of the intro to HTML with alot more advanced functions like if statements and else if statements and different classes that 
							can change the way buttons or links look and function. The Impact this module made on me is that I can now see how wesite now adays are so
							interactive. With this kind of coding the uses can interactd not only with others but the wesite it self making it feel more welcoming.

								<h3>Intro to JS</h3>
								<p>My favourite project in the intro to js module was the 8-ball, The introduction to if stements
								   and what you can do with them is very important and is somthing I will continue to use.As 
								   well as the animation protion of the module I am someone who really likes animations and 
								   this helped me understande that animation can be made with code.  </p>

								<h3>Intro to HTML/CSS</h3>
								<p>The Introduction to THTML/CSS module was about leanering how to use differnt types of texts with
								   Headers,style changes which can change baound and text colors and many more.The part of the
							           module at least for that had the biggest impact I think is the style changes. I think this
			                                           becuase it makes it so you can change your website in the way you want it to be making it 
								   more special and Unique</p>
							</section>"></span>
								<h3>Advanced JS:Natural Simulations</h3>
								<p>The Advanced JS:Natural Simulation module is an expantion on the more basic intro to Js.
									The advanced Js feture some new things like floors and randoms which are very important 
									components of coding making it so that the"pc" can play as well. I think that random function 
									is the most important because I my self like making games and with the random function you can 
									add a bot that the player can go against with the random function picking loctions and movements </p>

<h3>Intro to SQL </h3>
						                 <p> The intro to SQL focuses mainly on storying data in a data base for adding, modifiying and querying that data.
									     This module has impacted me in that I know have learned a differnet way to store data in code. This is very
									     important if I want to become a software engineer as there jobs are to make software which will have to store data in them.

								<h3>Algoritms</h3>
								<p>
								In the Algoritms module you learen about patterns that are found and codes and uses them to be able to change and sort data.
							        This module has given me the bases of computer programing as almost all things are Algoritms not just in computer science. An 
								example would be rubics cubes if you dont know the Algoritms for the cubes they are almost impossible to solve, this has taught
													      me that everything has some sort of pattern.
